		This package provides miscellaneous utility classes that don't
		belong strictly to an other xxl-package. It contains classes
		to create and work with one- or multidimensional intervals and
		tuples or even bit sets, a class to work dynamically with arrays
		and a class delivering a new RuntimeException thats wraps arbitary
		exceptions.
