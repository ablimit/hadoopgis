		Provides classes and routines for system input and output through 
		data streams, serialization, raw i/o and a FAT file system. 
		An alternatively serialization mechanism is included by defining 
		Converter and the Convertable interface. This allows the control
		over every byte which is stored in secondary memory.
		Last but not least, this package contains a Buffer
		implementation for the buffering of I/Os and a Block
		implementation for block based I/Os.<br>
		
		A larger bundle of buffered and
		unbuffered collections that uses external resources for storing
		their elements is included in the package 
		@link xxl.core.collections.io
		(and not here).
