/**
 * A taker is a {@link SecureDecoratorCursor decorator-cursor} that returns the
 * next <code>number</code> elements of a given iteration. The
 * <code>number</code> of elements that should be delivered from the given
 * iteration is defined by the user as well as the input iteration the elements
 * should be taken from.
 * 
 * <p><b>Implementation details:</b> The taker only contains further elements,
 * i.e., its <code>hasNext</code> method returns <code>true</code>, if the
 * underlying iteration has more elements and the number of elements returned
 * by the taker is lower than the given <code>number</code>. If
 * <code>next</code> is called the next element in the iteration is returned
 * and the <code>number</code> of elements to be delivered from the underlying
 * input iteration is decremented.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Note:</b> If the input iteration is given by an object of the class
 * {@link java.util.Iterator}, i.e., it does not support the <code>peek</code>
 * operation, it is internally wrapped to a cursor.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example usage:</b>
 * <code><pre>
 *   Taker&lt;Integer&gt; taker = new Taker&lt;Integer&gt;(new Enumerator(11), 5);
 *   
 *   taker.open();
 *   
 *   while (taker.hasNext())
 *       System.out.print(taker.next() +"; ");
 *   System.out.flush();
 *   
 *   taker.close();
 * </pre></code>
 * This instance of a taker delivers the first five elements of the given
 * {@link xxl.core.cursors.sources.Enumerator enumerator} which contains the
 * elements 0,...,10. So the output that results after consuming the entire
 * taker is:
 * <pre>
 *   0; 1; 2; 3; 4;
 * </pre></p>
 *
 * @param <E> the type of the elements returned by this iteration.
 * @see java.util.Iterator
 * @see xxl.core.cursors.Cursor
 * @see xxl.core.cursors.SecureDecoratorCursor
