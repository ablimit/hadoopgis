		The package <tt>xxl.core.cursors.filters</tt> provides miscellaneous
		implementations of filter operators on cursors. That means, the operators
		provided in this package will evaluate a user defined predicate on the
		elements of the given input iteration to decide how is to be dealt with
		these elements. E.g., the predicate of a
		{@link xxl.core.cursors.filters.Filter filter} decides whether an element
		of the input iteration should be returned to the user or simply filtered
		out. For compatibility reasons, all classes are able to handle user
		defined boolean functions as well as predicates.
