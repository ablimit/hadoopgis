		The package <tt>xxl.core.cursors.unions</tt> provides miscellaneous
		implementations of the union operator on cursors. Regardless of the order
		of the input iterations' elements in the unified iteration, the union
		operator returns every element of the input iterations exactly on time as
		its next element.
