/**
 * A merger serializes input iterations with respect to a given
 * {@link java.util.Comparator comparator} or
 * {@link xxl.core.collections.queues.Queue queue}. The input iterations are
 * inserted into a queue, e.g., a
 * {@link xxl.core.collections.queues.Heap heap}, defining a strategy for
 * merging them. Some queues need a comparator to put their elements in order,
 * so the caller is able to specify his queue and his comparator with special
 * constructors. The serialization of the input iteration's elements is
 * depending on the queue's implementation, e.g., the queue can use a
 * FIFO-strategy with the intention to receive a cyclic order of the input
 * iteration's elements.
 * <code><pre>
 *     cursors[0].next(),
 *     ...,
 *     cursors[cursors-1].next(),
 *     cursors[0].next(),
 *     ...
 * </pre></code>
 * But be aware, that the merger works with lazy-evaluation, so calling the 
 * <code>next</code> or <code>peek</code> method accesses the next cursor,
 * named <code>minCursor</code> delivered by the queue and calls its
 * <code>next</code> or <code>peek</code> method. If this iteration contains
 * further elements it will be added to the queue for an other time. The
 * position this iteration is inserted in the queue is defined by the queue's
 * strategy.
 * 
 * <p><b>Note:</b> When the given input iteration only implements the interface
 * {@link java.util.Iterator} it is wrapped to a cursor by a call to the static
 * method {@link xxl.core.cursors.Cursors#wrap(Iterator) wrap}.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Example usage (1):</b>
 * <code><pre>
 *   HashGrouper&lt;Integer&gt; hashGrouper = new HashGrouper&lt;Integer&gt;(
 *       new Enumerator(21),
 *       new Function&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;() {
 *           public Integer invoke(Integer next) {
 *               return next % 5;
 *           }
 *       }
 *   );
 *   
 *   hashGrouper.open();
 *   
 *   Cursor[] cursors = new Cursor[5];
 *   for (int i = 0; hashGrouper.hasNext(); i++)
 *       cursors[i] = hashGrouper.next();
 *   
 *   Merger&lt;Integer&gt; merger = new Merger&lt;Integer&gt;(
 *       ComparableComparator.INTEGER_COMPARATOR,
 *       (Iterator&lt;Integer&gt;[])cursors
 *   );
 *   
 *   merger.open();
 *   
 *   while (merger.hasNext())
 *       System.out.print(merger.next() + "; ");
 *   System.out.flush();
 *   
 *   merger.close();
 * </pre></code>
 * This example uses a hash-grouper to partition the input data, i.e., the
 * function (object modulo 5) is invoked on each element of the enumerator with
 * range 0,...,20. Because the <code>next</code> method of the hash-grouper
 * returns a cursor pointing to the next group, i.e., the next bucket in the
 * hash-map, all returned cursors are stored in a cursor array named
 * <code>cursors</code>. For more detailed information see
 * {@link xxl.core.cursors.groupers.HashGrouper}. This cursor array is given to
 * the constructor of the merger internally using the defined comparator that
 * compares two integer objects. This instance of a merger uses a
 * {@link xxl.core.collections.queues.Heap heap} to arrange the cursors,
 * because no queue has been specified in the constructor. Because of the
 * specified comparator and the implementation of the heap realizing a
 * min-heap, the elements in the buckets of the hash-map are merged and
 * returned in ascending order. The generated output is as follows:
 * <pre>
 *   0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p><b>Example usage (2):</b>
 * <code><pre>
 *   merger = new Merger&lt;Integer&gt;(
 *       new StackQueue&lt;Cursor&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;(),
 *       new Enumerator(11),
 *       new Enumerator(11, 21)
 *   );
 *   
 *   merger.open();
 *   
 *   while (merger.hasNext())
 *       System.out.print(merger.next() + "; ");
 *   System.out.flush();
 *   
 *   merger.close();
 * </pre></code>
 * In this case, the used queue realizes a LIFO-queue (last in first out), so
 * the second enumerator is completely consumed at first, then the elements of
 * the first enumerator are returned. So the elements are printed to the output
 * stream in the following order:
 * <pre>
 *   11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10;
 * </pre></p>
 *
 * @param <E> the type of the elements returned by this iteration.
 * @see java.util.Iterator
 * @see xxl.core.cursors.Cursor
 * @see xxl.core.cursors.AbstractCursor
 * @see java.util.Comparator
