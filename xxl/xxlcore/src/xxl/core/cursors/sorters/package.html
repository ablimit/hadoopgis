		The package <tt>xxl.core.cursors.sorters</tt> provides miscellaneous
		implementations of sort operators on cursors. Regardless of using main
		memory or external memory for performing the sort operation, a comparator
		must be given that defines an order on the elements of the input
		iteration. The external sorting (i.e., the "logical" sort-operator) can
		be implemented (with "physical" operators) in two ways:
		<ol>
		    <li>
		        Create sorted runs and merge them recursively
		        (external merge-sort) or
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        divide the input recursively into partitions until each partition
		        fits into main memory. Then the sort-operation is performed with
		        a main-memory sorting-algorithm (external distribution-sort).
		    </li>
		</ol>
