		The package <tt>xxl.core.cursors.joins</tt> provides miscellaneous
		implementations of the join operator on cursors. This operation can be
		performed in different ways:
		<ul>
		    <li>
		        As a theta-join, that returns a result-tuples if and only if a
		        user-defined predicate evaluated on this tuple is <tt>true</tt>.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        As a left outer-join, taht returns a result-tuple if a
		        user-defined predicate evaluated on this tuple is <tt>true</tt>
		        as well as all elements of the left (first) input iteration.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        As a right outer-join, that returns a result-tuple if a
		        user-defined predicate evaluated on this tuple is <tt>true</tt>
		        as well as all elements of the right (first) input iteration.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        A full outer-join, that returns the result-tuples for which a
		        user-defined predicate is <tt>true</tt> as well as all tuples
		        additionally returned by the left and right outer-join.
		    </li>
		</ul>
