		The package <tt>xxl.core.cursors.identities</tt> provides miscellaneous
		implementations of identity operators on cursors. These operators can
		have different tasks (like duplicating an input iteration, etc.) but they all
		have in common that the elements delivered by the input iteration are
		returned without being changed by them.
