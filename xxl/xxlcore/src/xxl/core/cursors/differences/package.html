		The package <tt>xxl.core.cursors.differences</tt> provides miscellaneous
		implementations of the difference operator on cursors. This operation can
		be performed in two different ways, on the one hand it removes an element
		of the first input iteration if the same element exists in the
		second one. On the other hand it removes all elements of the first input
		iteration that match with an element of the second one. This second
		approch implies that no duplicates will be returned by the difference
		operator, whereas the first solution may contain duplicates if the number
		of equal elements in the first input iteration is greater than that of
		the second one.
