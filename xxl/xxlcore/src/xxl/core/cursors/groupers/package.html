		The package <tt>xxl.core.cursors.groupers</tt> provides miscellaneous
		implementations of the group operator on cursors. That means, the
		operators provided in this package will group the element delivered by an
		input iteration into groups. Such a group is usually given by a cursor
		(or in some cases by an iterator) iterating over the elements of the
		group.
