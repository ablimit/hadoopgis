		The package <tt>xxl.core.cursors.distincts</tt> provides miscellaneous
		implementations of the distinct operator on cursors. That means, the
		operators provided in this package will remove duplicate elements from
		given input iterations. Whether two elements of the input iteration are
		duplicates or not will be decided by the evaluation of a predicate or
		alternatively by the evaluation of a boolean function.
