	Provides mappers for different type of Point and Rectangle objects as well as
	several join algorithms: nested loops distance similarity-join for Points,
	the spatial join algorithm based on space-filling curves proposed by 
	Jack Orenstein,	similarity-join algorithm "GESS: Generic External Space Sweep" 
	and hash-based plane sweep for two-dimensional data.
