	A collection of spatial queries. Some other queries not included in this package can easily 
	be derived from the existing ones:
	<br>
	For example, the DistanceQuery, which returns all objects whose distance to the query object
	is less than a given maximum can either be implemented using a RegionQuery or a NearestNeighbourQuery
	<br>
	<code><pre>  
	// Distance query using a RegionQuery and a buffer around the query- object
	Cursor distanceQuery1 = new RegionQuery(index, queryObject.buffer( distance ), loadGeometry);
	   
	// Distance query using a WhileTaker and a NearestNeighbourQuery
	Cursor distanceQuery2 = 
		new WhileTaker(
	       new NearestNeighbourQuery( index, queryObject,
	    		                      distDescToGeo, distGeoToGeo,
	    		                      loadGeometry),
	       new DistanceWithin( distance, 2)
		);  
	</pre></code>
