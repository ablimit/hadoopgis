	The package xxl.core combines the core functionality of our library. Applications can be found in the 
	main-methods of the classes and more advanced ones are distributed within the package xxl.applications.
	Functionality that relies on foreign libraries is provided in the package xxl.connectivity.
	<p>
	In order to get used with the library, we recommend to study the packages xxl.core.cursors, xxl.core.functions
	and xxl.core.predicates first. For a more detailed description of the functionality combined within the packages,
	we refer to their documentation.
