 * This class provides a skeletal implementation of the Bag interface, to

 * provide implementations for the cursor, insert and size methods. For
 * supporting the removal of elements, the cursor returned by the cursor method
 * must additionally implement its remove method.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The documentation for each non-abstract method in this class describes
 * its implementation in detail. Each of these methods may be overridden if the
 * bag being implemented admits a more efficient implementation.</p>
