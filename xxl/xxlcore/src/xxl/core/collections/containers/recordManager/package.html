	<BODY>
		Provides a decorator container that is able to store records
		(of type 
		{@link xxl.core.io.Block}
		) which are of different size. The size of each
		record has to be below a maximum size which is again below the 
		pageSize.
		<p>
		A RecordManager can be used on top of each container. Usually, 
		it is used on top of a 
		{@link xxl.core.collections.containers.io.BlockFileContainer} 
		or a
		{@link xxl.core.collections.containers.io.MultiBlockContainer}
		.
