/**
 * A Container is the interface implemented by all classes that deal with the
 * management of sets of objects.<p>
 *
 * A Container represents a set of items, known as its elements. An
 * element is a tuple consisting of an identifier <tt>id</tt> and an
 * <tt>object</tt>. An object in a container can only be retrieved when
 * the corresponding identifier is given. When inserting an object, or
 * when reserving space for an object, the container creates a new
 * <tt>id</tt> for this object and returns it to the caller. When an
 * object is deleted from a container, its <tt>id</tt> can be reused again.<p>
 *
 * An iterator is frequently used to retrieve the ids of a container, see
 * the method <tt>ids()</tt>. Moreover, a cursor is already implemented
 * that supports the direct access to the objects, see the method
 * <tt>objects()</tt>. When a collection is closed (see method
 * <tt>close()</tt>) the iterators and cursors can be in illegal states.
 * It might be that an iterator will still deliver data although the
 * corresponding container is already closed.<p>
 *
 * When an element is directly deleted from a container via
 * <tt>remove()</tt> or an element is inserted into a container via
 * <tt>insert()</tt>, the iterators and cursors can be in an illegal
 * state, see also the discussion in the previous paragraph. Note that
 * iterators and cursors may also have an operation <tt>remove()</tt>. In
 * particular, the <tt>remove()</tt> operation of an iterator should not
 * rely on the <tt>remove()</tt> operation of Container. When
 * <tt>remove()</tt> of an iterator is called, the iterator will still be
 * in a valid state. HOWEVER, the other iterators of the corresponding
 * container can be in illegal states. A similar problem occurs for
 * updates. When a cursor updates an element of the container, the other
 * iterators (and cursors) can be in illegal states. When a user of this
 * class is interested in a more restrictive semantic, he/she is advised
 * to implement the abstract methods <tt>ids()</tt> and <tt>objects()</tt>
 * adequately. Note, that these are the only methods for generating
 * iterators operating directly on a container.<p>
 *
 * Implementations of Container are available which manage the data in main
 * memory (e.g. {@link MapContainer MapContainer}) and external storage.
 * The later case will be more common. In order to reduce the number of
 * accesses to external memory, a buffer can be used to keep "interesting"
 * data in main memory. This aspect has some impact on the Container
 * class. Many of the methods below offer a parameter <tt>unfix</tt>. If
 * true, the method automatically has to unfix the object at the end of the
 * operation, i.e. an underlying buffer is allowed to remove the object
 * from memory (probably having it written back to external memory before).
 * Otherwise (<tt>unfix == false</tt>), the object will remain fixed, i.e.
 * the object can only be removed from memory if the method <tt>unfix()</tt>
 * has been called explicitly before. When a container uses a buffer,
 * the method <tt>flush()</tt> has to be implemented. The method writes
 * back the modified objects from the buffer to the container.
