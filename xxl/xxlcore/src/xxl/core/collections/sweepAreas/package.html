	This package provides so-called {@link xxl.core.collections.sweepAreas.SweepArea SweepAreas}.
	A SweepArea is a highly dynamic datastructure with flexible insertion, 
	retrieval and reorganization capabilities. It is utilized to remain the 
	state of an operation. <br>
	In order to decouple the reorganization capabilities of a SweepArea from
	its concrete implementation, the design pattern <i>Bridge</i> was chosen. 
	Therefore, each SweepArea relies on a {@link xxl.core.collections.sweepAreas.SweepAreaImplementor SweepAreaImplementor}.
	Such an implementor represents the underlying datastructure of a SweepArea, which
	can be list-, hash- or bag-based for instance. <br>
	SweepAreas are predominantly used in join operations. Hence, to understand 
	their usage and semantics, please take a closer look at the package
	{@link xxl.core.cursors.joins}.
