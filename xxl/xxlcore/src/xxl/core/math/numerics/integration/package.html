This package provides two techniques for the numerical integration of a {@link 
xxl.core.math.functions.RealFunction real-valued function} that is defined over an interval [a,b]. Both of them belong to the class of 
Newton-Cotes-Formulas. On the one hand there is the {@link xxl.core.math.numerics.integration.SimpsonsRuleRealFunctionArea 
Simpson's Rule} that bases on three weights, providing an approximation of order 
4. On the other hand there is {@link xxl.core.math.numerics.integration.TrapezoidalRuleRealFunctionArea 
Trapezoidal Rule} that bases on two weights, providing an approximation of order 
2. Both techniques are applied iteratively by partitioning the interval.
