The package xxl.core.math.numerics.splines computes a <tt>cubic Bezier-Spline</tt> interpolation with one of the two common boundary conditions for 
a one-dimensional {@link xxl.core.math.functions.RealFunction real-valued function} by determining the necessary parameters. The function, that is 
defined over <tt>[a,b]</tt>, is 
evaluated on a grid [a=x_0,x_1,...,b=x_n-1]. The <tt>cubic Bezier-Spline</tt> 
interpolate is especially qualified for approximating a function since it is in the class of
interpolating functions the one with the least fraction.  
<br>
For determining the unique <tt>cubic Bezier-Spline interpolate</tt>, one of two boundary conditions has to be 
choosen. The first one, called natural, postulates the function to fulfill a second derivative of zero in a and b.
For the second condition the values of the functions first derivative in a and b has to be known.
