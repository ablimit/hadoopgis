The package xxl.core.math.statistics.parametric provides several techniques based on parametrical statistics. This includes particularly online aggregates
as proposed in [HHW97]: J. Hellerstein, P. Haas, and H. Wang, 1997. These allow to build running aggregates while consuming a data stream. There, the
current result bases on the last aggregate and the new element. Some of the aggregates are even equipped with runnning confidence intervals.
