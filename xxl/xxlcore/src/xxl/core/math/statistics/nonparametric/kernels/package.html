The package xxl.core.math.statistics.nonparametric.kernels provides concrete kernels and abstract modellings. This includes one- and multidimensional
kernels. Also, kernel based estimators for an unknown density or an unknown cumulative distribution function are provided. Since the bandwidth of
of a kernel-based estimator is crucial for its quality, different strategies for the computation are available. For a more detailled coverage
of kernel estimations we refer to [Sco92]: D. Scott, Multivariate Density Estimation: Theory, Practice, and Visualization, 1992.
