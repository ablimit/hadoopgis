Edit Makefile (set appropriate LDFLAGS) to choose cpu or gpu kernel. Meanwhile, edit refine_and_do_spatial_op in
justdoit.c accordingly. By default, the Makefile uses cpu kernel.

Then, go to cpu or gpu directory and read Makefile to choose algorithm to use and do whatever needed before making.

Make in cpu or gpu directory first, then make under just_do_it.

Use `make test' or `make run' to test programs.
