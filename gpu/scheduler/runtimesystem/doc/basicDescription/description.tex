\section{Motivation/Objective}

The successful introduction of accelerators as general purpose processors is
changing current High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, which are nowadays
being deployed as heterogeneous CPU-GPU equipped platforms. Taking advantage of
those solutions, however, still be a very hard programming task, mainly due to
the lack of high level programming languages, and runtime frameworks to
abstract the complex interactions among applications and heterogeneous systems.
While some work has been done in order to execute simple kernel applications
using CPUs and GPUs cooperatively, including MapReduce computations for shared
memory machines~\cite{mars,merge,qilin09luk}, the execution of more complex
real world pipelined applications (e.g. with dependency among stages) in
distributed environments still a challenging open problem. The goal of this
work is to propose and implement runtime support to make easier/viable the
deployment of real complex applications on distributed environments. To
accomplish this tasks we will automate/hide from the user most of the complex
tasks regarding interactions of the application with the executing platform,
and provide a set of non-trivial optimizations/scheduling mechanisms.
