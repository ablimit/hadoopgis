    abstract = {{Iterative compilation is a widely adopted technique to optimize programs for different constraints such as performance, code size and power consumption in rapidly evolving hardware and software environments. However, in case of statically compiled programs, it is often restricted to optimizations for a specific dataset and may not be applicable to applications that exhibit different run-time behavior across program phases, multiple datasets or when executed in heterogeneous, reconfigurable and virtual environments. Several frameworks have been recently introduced to tackle these problems and enable run-time optimization and adaptation for statically compiled programs based on static function multiversioning and monitoring of online program behavior. In this article, we present a novel technique to select a minimal set of representative optimization variants (function versions) for such frameworks while avoiding performance loss across available datasets and code-size explosion. We developed a novel mapping mechanism using popular decision tree or rule induction based machine learning techniques to rapidly select best code versions at run-time based on dataset features and minimize selection overhead. These techniques enable creation of self-tuning static binaries or libraries adaptable to changing behavior and environments at run-time using staged compilation that do not require complex recompilation frameworks while effectively outperforming traditional single-version non-adaptable code.}},

    abstract = {{W}ith the proliferation of high-speed internet access, piracy of multimedia data has developed into a major problem and media distributors, such as photo agencies, are making strong efforts to protect their digital property. {S}ome recent work on image processing has therefore focused on content-based methods to detect image copyright violations, and a ``local descriptor'' method, which extracts several characteristic points of an image and describes through high-dimensional vectors, has been shown to be quite effective, albeit very inefficient. {W}e have applied a recent approximate query processing method, the {OMEDRANK} algorithm, to the image copyright protection method above and shown that it does not result in more efficient query processing without sacrificing the quality of the results. {T}herefore we have proposed a new index structure, the {PVS}-index, which segments the descriptor collection based on projections to random lines and utilizes all the nice properties of the {OMEDRANK} algorithm. {I}n a detailed performance study using a collection of over 20 million image descriptors, we show that using {OMEDRANK} on top of the {PVS}-index results in extremely efficient and effective query processing.},

    abstract = {This paper provides an up-to-date overview of the Sun Grid Engine distributed resource management software and of future plans to enhance it towards and integrate it into computational grid environments. The main scope of many of today's Grid research projects is to understand and demonstrate the actual potential of networking, computing and software infrastructure for computational Grids and to build proof-of-concept middleware. This has resulted in Internet infrastructure projects like Globus (Foster and Kesselman, 1997), Legion (Chapin et al., 1999), and Punch (Kapadia and Fortes, 1999) which enable users to combine a set of distributed resources into one integrated Grid Workbench to allow users to measure nature (e.g, with microscope, telescope or particle accelerator), process the measured data according to fundamental mathematical equations (e.g. the Navier-Stokes or Maxwell equations), and provide computer simulations and animations to study and understand these complex phenomena},

@inproceedings{ccgrid-multicore,
	abstract = {Multi-core processors are growing as a new industry trend as single core processors rapidly reach the physical limits of possible complexity and speed. In the new Top500 supercomputer list, more than 20\% processors belong to the multi-core processor family. However, without an indepth study on application behaviors and trends on multicore clusters, we might not be able to understand the characteristics of multi-core cluster in a comprehensive manner and hence not be able to get optimal performance. In this paper, we take on these challenges and design a set of experiments to study the impact of multi-core architecture on cluster computing. We choose to use one of the most advanced multi-core servers, Intel Bensley system with Woodcrest processors, as our evaluation platform, and use benchmarks including HPL, NAMD, and NAS as the applications to study. From our message distribution experiments, we find that on an average about 50\% messages are transferred through intra-node communication, which is much higher than intuition. This trend indicates that optimizing intranode communication is as important as optimizing internode communication in a multi-core cluster. We also observe that cache and memory contention may be a potential bottleneck in multi-core clusters, and communication middleware and applications should be multi-core aware to alleviate this problem. We demonstrate that multi-core aware algorithm, e.g. data tiling, improves benchmark execution time by up to 70\%. We also compare the scalability of a multi-core cluster with that of a single-core cluster and find that the scalability of the multi-core cluster is promising.},

  grids of distributed systems. As more parallel applications are being used on
  these grids, the need for some kind of parallel I/O facility across
  distributed systems increases. However, grid middleware has thus far had only
  limited support for distributed parallel I/O. In this paper, we present an
  implementation of the MPI-2 I/O interface using the Globus GridFTP client
  API. MPI is widely used for parallel computing, and its I/O interface maps
  onto a large variety of storage systems. The limitations of using GridFTP as
  an MPI-I/O transport mechanism are described, as well as support for parallel
  access to scientific data formats such as HDF and NetCDF. We compare the
  performance of GridFTP to that of NFS on the same network using several
  parallel I/O benchmarks. Our tests indicate that GridFTP can be a workable
  transport for parallel I/O, particularly for distributed read-only access to
  shared data sets. (26 refs.)}
