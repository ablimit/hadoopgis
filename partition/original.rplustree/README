This directory contains the source code for R+-trees.

Syntax:
	rpt df1 tree1 wf1
where
	"tree1.idx" is the r-tree to be created.
	"df1" is the data file (ascii format: id x1 y1 x2 y2).
	"wf1" is the window file (same format).

WARNING: "tree1" should be empty before execution. Otherwise, new data is
		 appended to old index.
